NAME
----
sloppy - A cross-platform Xboard compatible chess engine

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sloppy*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*sloppy* is a chess engine which uses the Xboard chess
engine communication protocol.

OPTIONS
-------
*sloppy* does not accept any options, see the CONFIGURATION section below.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
*sloppy* looks for the configuration file in this order:

* $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sloppy/sloppy.conf
* $HOME/.config/sloppy/sloppy.conf
* "sloppy.conf" in the current directory

The default configuration file looks like this:

-------------
# Sloppy's config file

# Hash table size in megabytes
hash = 36

# Use 5-men bitbases (on/off)
egbb_5men = off

# Endgame bitbase load type (4men/5men/smart/none/off)
# 4men: load 3-men and 4-men bitbases to RAM
# 5men: load 3-men, 4-men and 5-men bitbases to RAM
# smart: load a smart selection of bitbases to RAM
# none: load nothing to RAM
# off: disable bitbases completely
#
# Note: even if this option is set off, Xboard can still
# tell Sloppy to load the bitbases with the egtpath command.
egbb_load_type = off

# Endgame bitbase cache size in megabytes
egbb_cache = 4

# Endgame bitbase path
# Leave this empty if you want Xboard to set the path
# egbb_path = bitbases

# Book mode (disk/mem/off)
bookmode = mem

# Book learning (on/off)
learn = off

# Write logfile(s) (on/off)
logfile = off

# The number of threads Sloppy may use (currently for perft only).
# Comment it out if you want Sloppy to autodetect the best value.
# threads = 1

# End of config file
