COMPILING

   In UNIX/Linux systems just type "make" to compile Sloppy. There is no
   "make install" though, so if you want to install Sloppy to an other
   directory you'll need to copy the executable and the opening book (if any)
   to said directory.
  
   The Windows version compiles at least with Mingw and Microsoft's Visual C++
   compiler. Makefiles for both are included (Makefile.mgw and Makefile.win).


INTERFACE, COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

   Sloppy uses the Xboard chess engine communication protocol. So if you want to
   use a GUI (you probably do), make sure it implements Xboard protocol 2. If
   it only supports UCI, you can still use Sloppy with the wb2uci adapter:

   Sloppy doesn't accept any command line options, see configuration below.


CONFIGURATION

   Sloppy is configured by editing the configuration file ("sloppy.conf").

   On Windows systems the configuration file should be placed to the same
   directory where the executable is.

   On non-Windows systems the configuration file should be placed to
   $HOME/.config/sloppy/ directory.

   In addition to all Xboard input, Sloppy accepts these commands:
